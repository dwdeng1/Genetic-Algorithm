# Genetic-Algorithm
This is a command line genetic algorithm that has people in rows and seats. It scores the fitness of every generation. According to the specifications, it is supposed to 
simulate COVID-19. However, it does not take any special attributes or characteristics COVID-19 has.
This is written in c++, and was a school project. Special thanks to "vtle5" as I imported the wrong math library, and it wasn't working initially.
